**Welcome Alpha testers!**

**If you are testing the HUD and have come to this page because you have discovered an issue, please click the "Issues" tab above and fill out the form to report your issue.**

Our group is exploring the translation of libraries into Second Life, and implementing some solutions to problems we have found where important things get "lost in translation."

This site is our group's project base for the more technical elements of the site, including code source and issue tracking. If you would like to read information about our project from a non-technical perspective, please visit our [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/slgators) for documentation, a PDF of our full project proposal lit and other relevant material.

We are currently running an "alpha test" of our "book HUD," which retrieves and displays information from the Web about a test group of books (including information from Amazon.com and, where available, the text of the book itself.) Our process side-steps current problems in the display of literary material in Second Life, including the need to display the written content as an image (i.e. "rez" the contents.)

Our goal for our "alpha test" is to discover any major problems with the HUD that arise from a coding, interface or user experience perspective.
To see all issues please visit the issues tab, select all issues, then press search

Thank you for your interest in our project.
